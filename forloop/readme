Go (Golang)
Go has one primary loop type:

for loop: The only loop construct in Go, used for all looping scenarios.
Standard for loop: for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { fmt.Println(i) }
Condition-only (like while): for x < 5 { x++ }
Infinite loop: for { ... }
Range-based: for i, v := range slice { ... } (for iterating over arrays, slices, maps, strings, or channels).
Go also supports:

Nested loops: for loops within for loops.
Loop control statements:
break: Exits the loop.
continue: Skips to the next iteration.
goto: Jumps to a labeled statement (rarely used).
Summary
Python: 2 loop types (for, while) + control statements.
Go: 1 loop type (for, with multiple forms) + control statements.
