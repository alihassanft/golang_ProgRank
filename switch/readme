The switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

The switch statement in Go is similar to the ones in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. The difference is that it only runs the matched case so it does not need a break statement.

Single-Case switch Syntax
Syntax
switch expression {
case x:
   // code block
case y:
   // code block
case z:
...
default:
   // code block
}
This is how it works:

The expression is evaluated once
The value of the switch expression is compared with the values of each case
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
The default keyword is optional. It specifies some code to run if there is no case match
